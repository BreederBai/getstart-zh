<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent">Did you ever want to fly a plane yourself, but lacked the money or ability to
do so? Are you a real pilot looking to improve your skills without having to
take off? Do you want to try some dangerous maneuvers without risking your
life? Or do you just want to have fun with a more serious game without any
violence? If any of these questions apply to you, PC flight simulators are just for
you.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent">   You may already have some experience using Microsoft<a 
  name="dx5-5001"></a>&#8217;s &copy; Flight Simulator or any
other of the commercially available PC flight simulators. As the price tag of those is
usually within the $50 range, buying one of them should not be a serious problem given
that running any serious PC flight simulator requires PC hardware within the $1500
                                                                     

                                                                     
range, despite dropping prices.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent">   With so many commercially available flight simulators, why would we spend
thousands of hours of programming and design work to build a free flight simulator?
Well, there are many reasons, but here are the major ones:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">All of the commercial simulators have a serious drawback: they are made
     by a small group of developers defining their properties according to what
     is important to them and providing limited interfaces to end users. Anyone
     who  has  ever  tried  to  contact  a  commercial  developer  would  agree  that
     getting your voice heard in that environment is a major challenge. In contrast,
     <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is designed by the people and for the people with everything out
     in the open.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Commercial simulators are usually a compromise of features and usability.
     Most commercial developers want to be able to serve a broad segment of
     the population, including serious pilots, beginners, and even casual gamers.
     In reality the result is always a compromise due to deadlines and funding.
     As <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is free and open, there is no need for such a compromise.
     We have no publisher breathing down our necks, and we&#8217;re all volunteers
     that make our own deadlines. We are also at liberty to support markets that
     no commercial developer would consider viable, like the scientific research
     community.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Due to their closed-source nature, commercial simulators keep developers
     with  excellent  ideas  and  skills  from  contributing  to  the  products.  With
     <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>, developers of all skill levels and ideas have the potential to make
     a huge impact on the project. Contributing to a project as large and complex
     as <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is very rewarding and provides the developers with a great
     deal of pride in knowing that we are shaping the future of a great simulator.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Beyond everything else, it&#8217;s just plain fun! I suppose you could compare us
     to real pilots that build kit-planes or scratch-builts. Sure, we can go out a
     buy a prebuilt aircraft, but there&#8217;s just something special about building one
     yourself.</li></ul>

<!--l. 93--><p class="indent">   The points mentioned above form the basis of why we created <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>. With
those motivations in mind, we have set out to create a high-quality flight simulator that

Let us take a closer look at each of these characteristics:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb7t---109">Civilian:</span><a 
  name="dx5-5007"></a>  The  project  is  primarily  aimed  at  civilian  flight  simulation.  It
     should  be  appropriate  for  simulating  general  aviation  as  well  as  civilian
     aircraft. Our long-term goal is to have <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>FAA-approved as a flight
     training  device.  To  the  disappointment  of  some  users,  it  is  currently  not
     a  combat  simulator;  however,  these  features  are  not  explicitly  excluded.
     We just have not had a developer that was seriously interested in systems
     necessary for combat simulation.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb7t---109">Multi-platform:</span><a 
  name="dx5-5008"></a> The developers are attempting to keep the code as
     platform-independent as possible. This is based on their observation that people
     interested in flight simulations run quite a variety of computer hardware and
     operating systems. The present code supports the following Operating

several of the developers. Not only has Linux<a

highly sophisticated software projects over the Internet is possible, it has also proven
that such an effort can surpass the level of quality of competing commercial
products.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2</span> <a 
href="getstart.html#QQ2-5-6" name="x5-60001.2">System Requirements</a></h3>
<a 
  name="dx5-6001"></a>
<!--l. 173--><p class="noindent">In comparison to other recent flight simulators, the system requirements<a 
  name="dx5-6002"></a> for <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>
are not extravagant. A decent PII/400, or something in that range, should be
sufficient given you have a proper 3-D graphics card<a 
  name="dx5-6003"></a>. Additionally, any modern
UNIX<a 
  name="dx5-6004"></a>-type workstation<a 
  name="dx5-6005"></a> with a 3-D graphics card will handle <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>as
well.
<!--l. 179--><p class="indent">   One important prerequisite for running <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is a graphics card whose driver
supports OpenGL<a 
  name="dx5-6006"></a>. If you don&#8217;t know what OpenGL<a 
  name="dx5-6007"></a> is, the overview given at the
OpenGL website
<!--l. 183--><p class="indent">   <a 
href="http://www.opengl.org" >http://www.opengl.org</a>
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent">says it best: &#8220;Since its introduction in 1992, OpenGL has become the industry&#8217;s most
widely used and supported 2-D and 3-D graphics application programming interface
(API)...&#8221;.
<!--l. 191--><p class="indent">   <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>does not run (and will never run) on a graphics board which only
supports Direct3D<a 
  name="dx5-6008"></a>. Contrary to OpenGL, Direct3D is a proprietary interface, being
restricted to the Windows operating system.
<!--l. 195--><p class="indent">   You may be able to run <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>on a computer that features a 3-D video card
not supporting hardware accelerated OpenGL<a 
  name="dx5-6009"></a> - and even on systems without
3-D graphics hardware at all. However, the absence of hardware accelerated
                                                                     

                                                                     
OpenGL support can bring even the fastest machine to its knees. The typical
signal for missing hardware acceleration are frame rate<a 
  name="dx5-6010"></a>s below 1 frame per
second.
<!--l. 201--><p class="indent">   Any modern 3-D graphics featuring OpenGL<a 
  name="dx5-6011"></a> support will do. For Windows<a 
  name="dx5-6012"></a> video
card drivers that support OpenGL, visit the home page of your video card manufacturer.
You should note that sometimes OpenGL drivers<a 
  name="dx5-6013"></a> are provided by the manufacturers of
the graphics chip instead of by the makers of the board. If you are going to buy a
graphics card for running <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>, one based on a NVIDIA chip (TNT X/Geforce X)
might be a good choice.
<!--l. 208--><p class="indent">   To install the executable and basic scenery, you will need around 50 MB of free disk
space<a 
  name="dx5-6014"></a>. In case you want/have to to compile the program yourself you will need about an
additional 500 MB for the source code and for temporary files created during
compilation. This does not include the development environment, which will vary in size
depending on the operating system and environment being used. Windows users can
expect to need approximately 300 MB of additional disk space for the development
environment. Linux and other UNIX machines should have most of the development
tools already installed, so there is likely to be little additional space needed on those
platforms.
<!--l. 217--><p class="indent">   For the sound effects<a 
  name="dx5-6015"></a>, any capable sound card<a 
  name="dx5-6016"></a> should suffice. Due to its flexible
design, <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>supports a wide range of joysticks<a 
  name="dx5-6017"></a> and yokes<a 
  name="dx5-6018"></a> as well as rudder pedals<a 
  name="dx5-6019"></a>
under Linux<a 
  name="dx5-6020"></a> and Windows<a 
  name="dx5-6021"></a>. <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>can also provide interfaces to full-motion flight
chairs.
<!--l. 222--><p class="indent">   <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is being developed primarily under Linux<a 
  name="dx5-6022"></a>, a free UNIX clone (together
with lots of GNU utilities) developed cooperatively over the Internet in much the same
spirit as <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>itself. <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>also runs and is partly developed under several
flavors of Windows<a 
  name="dx5-6023"></a>. Building <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>is also possible on a Macintosh OSX and
several different UNIX/X11 workstations. Given you have a proper compiler<a 
  name="dx5-6024"></a> installed,
<span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>can be built under all of these platforms. The primary compiler for all
platforms is the free GNU C++<a 
  name="dx5-6025"></a> compiler (the Cygnus<a 
  name="dx5-6026"></a> Cygwin<a 
  name="dx5-6027"></a> compiler under
Win32).
<!--l. 230--><p class="indent">   If you want to run <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>under Mac OSX we suggest a Power PC G3 300 MHz
or better. As a graphics card we would suggest an ATI Rage 128 based card as a
minimum. Joysticks are supported under Mac OS 9.x only; there is no joystick support
under Max OSX at this time.

developmental branch.<a 
  name="dx5-7002"></a><a

refer to stable releases, while odd numbers like 0.7, 0.9, and so on refer to developmental
releases. The policy is to only do bug fixes in the even versions, while new features are
generally added to odd-numbered versions which, after all things have stabilized, will
become the next stable release with a version number calculated by adding
0.1.
<!--l. 247--><p class="indent">   To add to the confusion, there usually are several versions of the &#8220;unstable&#8221; branch.

  name="dx5-8006"></a>, and for an experimental plane called X15<a 
  name="dx5-8007"></a>. Jon and his group
are gearing towards a very accurate flight model, and the JSB model has become
<span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear</span>&#8217;s default flight model.
<!--l. 324--><p class="indent">   As an interesting alternative, Christian Mayer developed a flight model of a hot air
balloon. Moreover, Curt Olson integrated a special slew mode called Magic Carpet,
which helps you to quickly fly from point A to point B.
<!--l. 328--><p class="indent">   Recently, Andrew Ross contributed another flight model called <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">YASim</span><a 
  name="dx5-8008"></a> for <span 
class="ptmri7t---109">Yet</span>
<span 
class="ptmri7t---109">Another Simulator</span>. At present, it sports another Cessna 172<a 
  name="dx5-8009"></a>, a Turbo 310<a 
  name="dx5-8010"></a>, a fairly good
DC-3<a 
  name="dx5-8011"></a> model, along with a Boeing 747<a 
  name="dx5-8012"></a>, Harrier<a 
  name="dx5-8013"></a>, and A4<a 
  name="dx5-8014"></a>. <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">YASim </span>takes a fundamentally
different approach since it&#8217;s based on geometry information rather than aerodynamic
coefficients. Where JSBSim will be exact for every situation that is known and flight
tested, but may have odd and/or unrealistic behavior outside normal flight, YASim will
be sensible and consistent in almost every flight situation, but is likely to differ in
performance numbers.
<!--l. 337--><p class="indent">   As a further alternative, there is the UIUC flight model<a 
  name="dx5-8015"></a>. It was developed by a team
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to research aircraft icing. The
project uses <span 
class="ptmbi7t---109">FlightGear </span>as it&#8217;s frontend for doing visual simulations. Learn more about
this project at its homepage

<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent">The UIUC provides a host of different aircraft including several Cessna C172<a 
  name="dx5-8016"></a>, a Learjet
24<a 
  name="dx5-8017"></a>, a Twin Otter<a 
  name="dx5-8018"></a> and much more.
<!--l. 351--><p class="indent">   Please note, that the UIUC models do <span 
class="ptmb7t---109">not </span>have a working gear model. You might
experience some difficulties when starting on the ground. The nose gear will be too
weak, and the airplane will tend to fall on it&#8217;s nose. This can be circumvented by starting
in the air or pulling back on the stick more than usual.
                                                                     

                                                                     
<!--l. 356--><p class="indent">   It is even possible to drive FlightGear&#8217;s scene display using an external FDM<a 
  name="dx5-8019"></a> running
on a different computer - although this might not be a setup recommended to people just
getting in touch with <span
