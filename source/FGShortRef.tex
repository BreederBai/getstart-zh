\scriptsize \noindent
%\footnotesize \noindent
 \FlightGear{} is a free flight simulator developed collectively over the
 Internet under the GPL.\\

 \noindent
 \textbf{Main Web site:} \web{http://www.flightgear.org/}
 \medskip

 \hspace*{-8mm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Program Start:}  & Linux/UNIX via the script runfgfs under /FlightGear,\\
                         & Windows via the Batch file runfgfs.bat under /FlightGear
\end{tabular}
 \medskip

\hspace*{-8mm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Engine Start:}  & Put ignition switch to ''BOTH''. Set mixture to 100\,\%. Set throttle to about 25\,\%.\\
                        & Operate starter using the SPACE key. Set throttle back to idle after starting the engine. Release parking brake, if applied.

 \textbf{Mouse controlled functions:}
 There are three mouse modi. In the usual mode (pointer curser) panel's controls can be operated
 with the mouse. To change a control, click with the left/middle mouse button on the
 corresponding knob/lever. While the left mouse button leads to small increments/decrements,
 the middle one makes greater ones. Clicking on the left hand side of the knob/lever
 decreases the value, while clicking on the right hand side increases it.

 \noindent
 Right clicking the mouse activates the simulator control mode (cross hair cursor). This allows
 control of aileron/elevator via the mouse in absence of a joystick
 (enable \texttt{-$ $-enable-auto-coordination} in this case).

 \noindent
 Right clicking the mouse another time activates the view control mode (arrow cursor).
 This allows changing direction of view via the mouse.

 \noindent
 Right clicking the mouse once more resets it into the initial state.
