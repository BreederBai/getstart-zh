 \FlightGear{} is a free flight simulator developed collectively over the
 Internet under the GPL.  For more information see  \web{http://www.flightgear.org/}\\

\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Program Start:}  & Linux/UNIX via fgfs under FlightGear/,\\
                         & Mac OS X via FlightGear.app under /Applications/,\\
                         & Windows via the \FlightGear{} wizard fgrun.exe under
         $\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$FlightGear$\backslash$bin$\backslash$Win32$\backslash$\\

\textbf{Engine Start:}   & Set ignition switch to BOTH (``\}'' three times). Set mixture to 100\%.
                           Set throttle to about 25\%. Operate starter using the ``s'' key. \\
                         & Once the engine has started, set throttle back to idle.
                           Release parking brake (``B''), if applied.

 \textbf{Mouse controlled functions:}
 There are three mouse modes, which can be swapped between by clicking the right mouse button.

 \begin{enumerate}
 \item In \textbf{normal} mode (pointer cursor), the panel and cockpit controls can be
 operated using the mouse. To change a control, click with the left/middle mouse button
 on the corresponding knob/lever. Generally, the left side of the control decreases the setting,
 while the right side increases the setting. The left mouse button makes small changes while the
 middle button makes larger ones. The scrollwheel may be used on some controls.
 Press Ctrl-c to view panel/cockpit hotspots.

 \item In \textbf{control} mode (cross hair cursor), the mouse is used to directly control
 the aircraft in the absence of a joystick. Moving the mouse controls the aileron (left/right)
 and elevator (forwards/backwards). Holding the left mouse button down allows control of the rudder (left/right), while holding the middle mouse button controls throttle (forwards/backwards). The scrollwheel controls
 elevator trim. Using auto-coordination (\texttt{-$ $-enable-auto-coordination}) is recommended.

 \item In \textbf{view} mode (arrow cursor), you can control the view direction using the mouse.
 Clicking the left mouse button resets the view direction. Holding the middle button down while
 moving the mouse shifts the viewpoint. The scrollwheel may be used to control the field of view.

\end{enumerate}
