\chapter{Tutorials\label{tutorials}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you are new to flying, an advanced simulator such as \FlightGear{} can seem
daunting: You are presented with a cockpit of an aircraft with little 
information on how to fly it.

In real life, you would have an instructor sitting next to you to teach you how 
to fly and keep you safe.

While we cannot provide a personal instructor for every virtual pilot, there are
a number of tutorials available that you can follow to become a proficient
virtual pilot.

\section{In-flight Tutorials}

\FlightGear{} contains an in-flight tutorial system, where a simulated 
instructor provides a virtual `lesson'. To access tutorials, Select Start 
Tutorial from the Help menu. Tutorials are only available on some aircraft.

The tutorial system works particularly well with the Festival TTS system 
(described above).

For simplicity, run tutorials with AI aircraft turned off from
the Options item on the AI/ATC menu. Otherwise, ATC messages 
may make it difficult to hear your instructor.

Each tutorial consists of your instructor giving you a number of directions and
observing how you perform them.  If you fail to follow the directions, the
instructor will provide information on how to correct your deviation. At the end
of the tutorial, the number of deviations is shown. The fewer deviations you
make, the better you have performed in the tutotial.

Within a tutorial, to ask your instructor to repeat any instructions, press 
`+'. You can pause the tutorial at any time using the `p' key. To stop the 
tutorial select Stop Tutorial from the Help menu. 

\subsection{Cessna 172P tutorials}

A number of flight tutorials exist for the Cessna 172p, based around Half-Moon 
Bay airport (KHAF) near San Francisco, provided in the base package. To start 
the tutorials, select the Cessna 172P aircraft, and a starting airport of 
KHAF, using the wizard, or the command line:

\begin{verbatim}
$ fgfs --aircraft=c172p --airport=KHAF
\end{verbatim}

When the simulator has loaded, select Start Tutorial from the Help menu. You
will then be presented with a list of the tutorials available. Select a tutorial
and press Next. A description of the tutorial is displayed. Press Start
 to start the tutorial.

\section{FlightGear Tutorials}

The following chapters provide \FlightGear{} specific tutorials
to take the budding aviator from their first time in an aircraft to flying in 
the clouds, relying on their instruments for navigation. If you have never flown
a small aircraft before, following the tutorials provides an excellent 
introduction to flight.

Outside of this manual, there is an excellent tutorial written by David
Megginson \index{Megginson, David} -- being one of the main developers
of \FlightGear{} -- on flying a basic airport circuit specifically
using \FlightGear{}. This document includes a lot of screen shots,
numerical material etc., and is available from

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Docs/Tutorials/circuit}.
\medskip

\section{Other Tutorials}

There are many non-\FlightGear{} specific \Index{tutorial}s, many of which are 
applicable. First, a quite comprehensive manual of this type is the 
\Index{Aeronautical Information Manual}, published by the \Index{FAA}, 
and available at

\medskip
\web{http://www.faa.gov/ATPubs/AIM/}.
\medskip
\noindent

This is the Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and ATC Procedures by 
the FAA. It contains a lot of information on flight rules, flight safety, 
navigation, and more. If you find this a bit too hard work, you may prefer 
the \Index{FAA Training Book},

\medskip
\web{http://avstop.com/AC/FlightTraingHandbook/},
\medskip
\noindent

which covers all aspects of flight, beginning with the theory of flight and the
working of airplanes, via procedures like takeoff and landing up to emergency 
situations. This is an ideal reading for those who want to learn some basics on 
flight but don't (yet) want to spend bucks on getting a costly paper pilot's 
handbook.

While the handbook mentioned above is an excellent introduction on \Index{VFR} 
(Visual Flight Rules), it does not include flying according to \Index{IFR} 
(Instrument Flight Rules). However, an excellent introduction into navigation 
and flight according to Instrument Flight Rules written by Charles Wood
\index{Wood, Charles} can be found at

\web{http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/}.

Another comprehensive but yet readable text is John Denker's\index{Denker, John}
''\Index{See how it flies}'', available at
\medskip

\web{http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/how/htm/title.html}.
\medskip

 \noindent
This is a real online text book, beginning with Bernoulli's principle, drag and
power, and the like, with the later chapters covering even advanced aspects of 
VFR as well as IFR flying
