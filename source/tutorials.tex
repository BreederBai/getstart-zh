\section{FlightGear Tutorials}

A range of \FlightGear{} tutorials are available from various sources targetted at different users. 

Eric Brasseur has written a very good tutorial for people completely new to \FlightGear{}, and flying in general. It also describes many basic principles of flight. Accessible here: 

\medskip
\web{http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/flight\_simulator\_tutorial.html}.
\medskip

Secondly, there is an excellent \Index{tutorial} written by David
Megginson \index{Megginson, David} -- being one of the main developers
of \FlightGear{} -- on flying a basic airport circuit specifically
using \FlightGear{}. This document includes a lot of screen shots,
numerical material etc., and is available from

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Docs/Tutorials/circuit}.
\medskip

A tutorial describing cross-country flight in FlightGear can be found in the following section.

\section{Other Tutorials}

There are many non-\FlightGear{} specific \Index{tutorial}s, many of which are applicable. First, a quite
comprehensive manual of this type is the \Index{Aeronautical Information Manual}, published by the \Index{FAA}, and being online
available at

\medskip
\web{http://www.faa.gov/ATPubs/AIM/}.
\medskip
\noindent

This is the Official Guide to Basic Flight Information and ATC Procedures by the FAA. It
contains a lot of information on flight rules, flight safety, navigation, and more. If
you find this a bit too hard reading, you may prefer the \Index{FAA Training Book},

\medskip
\web{http://avstop.com/AC/FlightTraingHandbook/},
\medskip
\noindent

which covers all aspects of flight, beginning with the theory of flight and the working
of airplanes, via procedures like takeoff and landing up to emergency situations. This is
an ideal reading for those who want to learn some basics on flight but don't (yet) want
to spend bucks on getting a costly paper pilot's handbook.

While the handbook mentioned above is an excellent introduction on \Index{VFR} (visual
flight rules), it does not include flying according to \Index{IFR} (instrument flight
rules). However, an excellent introduction into navigation and flight according to
Instrument Flight Rules written by Charles Wood\index{Wood, Charles} can be found at

\web{http://www.navfltsm.addr.com/}.

Another comprehensive but yet readable text is John Denker's\index{Denker, John}
''\Index{See how it flies}'', available at
\medskip

\web{http://www.monmouth.com/~jsd/how/htm/title.html}.
\medskip

 \noindent
This is a real online text book, beginning with Bernoulli's principle, drag and power,
and the like, with the later chapters covering even advanced aspects of VFR as well as
IFR flying
