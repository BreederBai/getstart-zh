\chapter{Preflight: Installing \FlightGear{} \label{prefligh}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To run \FlightGear{} you need to install the binaries. Once you've done this you may install additional scenery and aircraft if you wish.

Pre-compiled binaries for the latest release are available for 

\begin{itemize}
\item Windows - any flavor,
\item Macintosh OSX,
\item Linux,
\item SGI Irix.
\end{itemize}

To download them go to 

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/binary.shtml}
\medskip

and follow the instructions provided on the page.

If you are running on another OS, or wish to compile for yourself, see Appendix~\ref{building}, \textit{Building the plane: Compiling the program}.

\section{Installing scenery}\index{scenery!additional}\index{additional scenery}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \FlightGear{} base package contains scenery for a small area around San Fransisco, but the entire world is available at a high level of detail, so you will almost certainly wish to install extra scenery at some point.

The scenery is based on \Index{SRTM} elevation data (accurate to 30m in the USA, and 90m elsewhere and) \Index{VMap0} land use data. Additionally, various people have created buildings, bridges and other features to enrich the environment.

You can download scenery in 10 degree by 10 degree chunks from a clickable map at

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/scenery.html}
\medskip

Curt Olson\index{Olson, Curt} also provides the USA or the entire world along with the latest FlightGear release on DVD from here:

\medskip
\web{http://cdrom.flightgear.org/}
\medskip

If you are interested in generating your own scenerey, have a look at TerraGear - the tools that generate the scenery for \FlightGear{}:

\medskip
\web{http://www.terragear.org/}
\medskip

Finally, an alternative data set was produced by William Riley\index{Riley, William} and is available from here:

\medskip
\web{http://www.randdtechnologies.com/fgfs/newScenery/world-scenery.html}.
\medskip

\medskip
Whatever scenery you shoose to download, it should be kept in a separate directory from the scenery delivered with the binaries. 

To do this, create a \texttt{WorldScenery} directory in the \FlightGear{} data directory, usually 

\texttt{c:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$FlightGear$\backslash$data} 

\noindent on Windows or 

\texttt{/usr/local/share/FlightGear/data} 

\noindent on *nix.

Underneath this directory create \texttt{Terrain} and \texttt{Objects} subdirectories. These are used for terrain information and buildings/bridges/structures respectively.

Unpack the downloaded scenery into the \texttt{WorldScenery/Terrain}. Do not de-compress the numbered
scenery files like 958402.gz! This will be done by \FlightGear{} on the fly. 

As an example, consider installation of the scenery package w120n30 containing the Grand
Canyon Scenery into an installation located at 

\texttt{/usr/local/share/FlightGear}.

Once your installation is complete, you'll have the following directories
\medskip

\begin{verbatim}
/usr/local/FlightGear/data/WorldScenery/Objects/
/usr/local/FlightGear/data/WorldScenery/Terrain/w120n30/w112n30
/usr/local/FlightGear/data/WorldScenery/Terrain/w120n30/w112n31
...
/usr/local/FlightGear/data/WorldScenery/Terrain/w120n30/w120n39
\end{verbatim}
\medskip

As well as the scenery itself, objects such as bridges, skyscrapers, radio masts can be downloaded
from \web{http://fgfsdb.stockill.org}. See the website for more information.
\medskip
You can exploit \texttt{FG\_SCENERY} environmental variable or the \texttt{-$ $-fg-scenery={\it path}} command line option if you want to install different scenery sets in parallel or want to have scenery sitting in another place. These are more fully described in Chapter \ref{takeoff}.

\section{Installing aircraft}\index{aircraft!installation}\index{installing aircraft}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The base \FlightGear{} package contains only a small subset of the aircraft that are available for \FlightGear{}. 
Developers have created a wide range of aircraft, from WWII fighters like the Spitfire, to passenger planes like the Boeing 747.

You can download aircraft from 

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/aircraft/index.shtml}
\medskip

Simply download the file and unpack it into the \texttt{FlightGear/data/Aircraft} subdirectory of your installation. Next time you run \FlightGear{}, the new aircraft will be available.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installing documentation}\index{documentation!installation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of the packages named above include the complete \FlightGear{} documentation
including a \.pdf version of this \textit{Installation and Getting Started} Guide intended
for pretty printing using Adobe's Acrobat Reader being available from
 \medskip

\web{http://www.adobe.com/acrobat}
 \medskip

 \noindent
 Moreover, if properly installed, the \.html version can be accessed via
\FlightGear{}'s \texttt{help} menu entry.

Besides, the source code contains a directory \texttt{docs-mini} containing numerous
ideas on and solutions to special problems. This is also a good place for further
reading.
