\chapter{Preflight: Installing \FlightGear{} \label{prefligh}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To run \FlightGear{} you need to install the binaries. Once you've done this you may install additional scenery and aircraft if you wish.

Pre-compiled binaries for the latest release are available for

\begin{itemize}
\item Windows - any flavor,
\item Mac OS X,
\item Linux.
\end{itemize}

To download them go to

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/binary.shtml}
\medskip

and follow the instructions provided on the page.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installing scenery}\index{scenery!additional}\index{additional scenery}\index{scenery}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Detailed \FlightGear{} scenery is available for the entire world, allowing
you to fly everywhere from the Himalaya mountains to rural Kansas.
The \FlightGear{} base package contains scenery for a small area around San
Francisco, so to fly elsewhere you will need to download additional scenery.

Each piece of scenery is packaged into a compressed archive, or tarball, in
a 10 degree by 10 degree chunk. Each tarball is named after the 10x10 degree
chunk it represents, for example w130n50.tgz.

You can download scenery from a clickable map here:

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/scenery.html}
\medskip

Alternatively, you can support the \FlightGear{} project by purchasing a complete
set of scenery for the entire world from here:

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/cdrom/}
\medskip

Once you have downloaded the tarball onto your computer, you need to find the
\texttt{Scenery} directory of your \FlightGear{} installation.

\begin{itemize}
\item For Windows, this directory is likely to be

\texttt{c:$\backslash$Program Files$\backslash$FlightGear$\backslash$data$\backslash$Scenery}.
\item For Unices, it is usually

\texttt{/usr/local/share/FlightGear/data/Scenery}.
\item For Mac OS X, it is usually either

\texttt{/Applications/FlightGear.app/Contents/Resources/data/Scenery}.

\end{itemize}

To install the scenery, uncompress the tarball into the \texttt{Scenery}
directory. Most operating system provide tools to uncompress tarballs. If you cannot
uncompress the tarball, install an extractor program such as 7-zip
(\web{http://www.7-zip.org/}.

Note that you should not decompress the numbered scenery files inside the tarball like
958402.gz - this will be done by \FlightGear{} on the fly.

Once you have uncompressed the tarball, the \texttt{Terrain} and \texttt{Objects} direcories
will contain additional sub-directories with your new scenery inside.

To use the new scenery, simply select a starting airport within the new scenery.
If you are using the \FlightGear{} Launcher, you will need to press the Refresh
button before you select your airport.

\subsection{MS Windows Vista}
If you are using Windows Vista, you may find that Windows installs downloaded scenery
(and aircraft) to your Virtual Store:

\noindent
{ \footnotesize{\texttt{c:$\backslash$Users$\backslash$(Your
Name)$\backslash$AppData$\backslash$Local$\backslash$VirtualStore$\backslash$Program
Files$\backslash$FlightGear$\backslash$Scenery}}}

If it does this, you need to copy the \texttt{Terrain} and \texttt{Objects}
directories manually to your real \FlightGear{} \texttt{Scenery} directory
as described above.

\subsection{Mac OS X \label{sceneryOnMac}}
You may install the downloaded scenery data and aircraft using the GUI launcher. Pressing \textit{Install Add-On data} on the \textit{Advanced Features >> Others} tab opens up the file browser window. Selecting one or more scenery data files will install the scenery data into /Applications/FlightGear.app/Contents/Resources/data/Scenery. Acceptable formats for the scenery data are one of zip, tar.gz, tgz, tar, and extracted folder. If the installation via the GUI launcher failure for some reason, you still have an alternative way to install the data. Opening the data folder by pressing ``Open data folder'' on the Others tab will pop up an Finder window for the data folder. Dragging an aircraft folder to data/Aircraft folder (or a scenery folder to data/Scenery folder) under the data folder will get the job done.

\subsection{FG\_SCENERY}\index{FG\_SCENERY}

If you would prefer to keep your downloaded scenery separate from the core
installation, you can do so by setting your \texttt{FG\_SCENERY} environmental
variable.

This is where \FlightGear{} looks for Scenery files. It consists of a list
of directories that will be searched in order. The directories are separated
by ``:'' on Unix (including Mac OS X) and ``;'' on Windows.

For example, a \texttt{FG\_SCENERY} environmental variable set to

\noindent
\texttt{/home/joebloggs/WorldScenery:/usr/local/share/Flightgear/data/Scenery}

\noindent
searches for Scenery in
\noindent
\texttt{/home/joebloggs/WorldScenery}
first, followed by
\noindent
\texttt{/usr/local/share/Flightgear/data/Scenery}.

\subsection{Fetch Scenery as you fly}

\FlightGear{} comes with a tool \TerraSync{}\index{TerraSync} which
allows to fetch the Scenery as you fly, if you have a permanent
Internet connection at your disposal. Create an empty 'working'
directory for \TerraSync{}, writable to the user and point
\FlightGear{} at this directory using the \texttt{FG\_SCENERY} variable
(as explained above). Do \textbf{not} let \TerraSync{} download Scenery
into your pre-installed Scenery directory.

\TerraSync{} expects you to feed FlightGear's current position via the
'Atlas' protocol, so call \FlightGear{} with the:

\texttt{--atlas=socket,out,1,localhost,5505,udp}

command line parameter and tell \TerraSync{} about the port number you're
using as well as the respective directory:

\texttt{terrasync -p 5505 -S -d /usr/local/share/TerraSync}
\medskip

On Mac OS X, just checking ``Download scenery on the fly'' on the GUI
launcher invokes \TerraSync{} automatically for downloading the Scenery
around your aircraft, so you don't have to specify the atlas option or 
FG\_SCENERY at all. 

There is a chicken/egg problem when you first start up in a brand new
area.  \FlightGear{} is expecting the Scenery to be there now but it may
not have been fetched yet. Therefore it's suggested to exit \FlightGear{}
after \TerraSync{} has caught up and finally to restart FlightGear.

Note that \TerraSync{} (when called with the "\texttt{-S}" command line
switch, as recommended) is going to download Scenery via the Subversion
protocol over HTTP. Thus, is your Internet access is set up to use a
HTTP proxy, plase make yourself aware how to configure the "libsvn"
Subversion client for use of a proxy. If you are using Mac OS X 10.5,
The GUI launcher automatically specifies -S if svn is available.
\medskip

Benefit: \TerraSync{} will always fetch the latest and greatest Scenery
from the FlightGear World (Custom) Scenery Project and therefore allows
feeding incremental updates to the user independent from comprehensive
World Scenery releases.

\subsection{Creating your own Scenery}

If you are interested in generating your own Scenery, have a look at TerraGear -
the tools that generate the Scenery for \FlightGear{}:

\medskip
\web{http://www.terragear.org/}
\medskip

The most actively maintained source tree of the TerraGear toolchain is
co-located at the \FlightGear{} landuse data Mapserver:

\medskip
\web{http://mapserver.flightgear.org/git/gitweb.pl}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installing aircraft}\index{aircraft!installation}\index{installing aircraft}\label{install_aircraft}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The base \FlightGear{} package contains only a small subset of the aircraft that are available for \FlightGear{}.
Developers have created a wide range of aircraft, from WWII fighters like the Spitfire, to passenger planes like the Boeing 747.

You can download aircraft from

\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/aircraft/index.shtml}
\medskip

Simply download the file and uncompress it into the
\texttt{data/Aircraft} subdirectory of your installation. The
aircraft are downloaded as \texttt{.tar.gz} files. Some computers will download
them as \texttt{.tar.gz.zip} files. If so, simply rename the file to
\texttt{.tar.gz} before uncompressing them. If you are successful, there will be a new
sub-directory in your \texttt{FG\_ROOT/data/Aircraft} directory containing the
aircraft. Next time you run \FlightGear{}, the new aircraft will be available. 

On Mac OS X, you may use the GUI launcher to install the downloaded aircraft files as shown in section \ref{sceneryOnMac}.

\section{Installing documentation}\index{documentation!installation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Most of the packages named above include the complete \FlightGear{}
documentation including a PDF version of \textit{The FlightGear
Manual} intended for pretty printing using Adobe's Acrobat Reader,
available from
\medskip

\web{http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/}
 \medskip

 \noindent
 Moreover, if properly installed, the \.html version can be accessed via
\FlightGear{}'s \texttt{help} menu entry.

Besides, the source code contains a directory \texttt{docs-mini} containing numerous
ideas on and solutions to special problems. This is also a good place for further
reading.
