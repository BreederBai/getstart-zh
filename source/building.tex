%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\markboth{\thechapter.\hspace*{1mm} BUILDING THE
PLANE}{\thesection\hspace*{1mm} COMPILING UNDER LINUX}

This central chapter describes how to build \FlightGear{} on several systems. In case you
are on a Win32 (i.\,e. Windows95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP) platform or any of the other platforms
which binary executables are available for, you may not want to go though that
potentially troublesome process but skip that chapter instead and straightly go to the
next one. (Not everyone wants to build his or her plane himself or herself, right?)
However, there may be good reason for at least trying to build the simulator:

\begin{itemize}
\item In case you are on a \Index{UNIX}/\Index{Linux} platform there may be no
pre-compiled binaries\index{binaries, pre-compiled} available for your system. In
practice it is common to install programs like this one on \Index{UNIX} systems by
recompiling them.

\item There are several options you can set during compile time only.

\item You may be proud you did.
\end{itemize}

On the other hand, compiling \FlightGear{} is not a task for novice users. Thus, if
you're a beginner (we all were once) on a platform which \Index{binaries} are available
for, we recommend postponing this task and just starting with the binary
distribution\index{distribution!binary} to get you flying.

As you will notice, this Chapter is far from being complete. Basically, we describe
compiling for two operating systems only, \Index{Windows} and \Index{Linux}, and for only
one compiler, the GNU C compiler. \FlightGear{} has been shown to be built under
different compilers (including Microsoft Visual C) as well as different systems
(Macintosh) as well. The reason for these limitations are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Personally, we have access to a Windows machine running the Cygnus compiler only.
\item According to the mailing lists, these seem to be the systems with the largest user base.
\item These are the simplest systems to compile \FlightGear{} on. Other compilers may need special
add-ons (workplace etc.) or even modification of the code.
\item The GNU compiler is free in the same sense of the GPL as \FlightGear{} is.
\end{itemize}

You might want to check Section \ref{missed}, \textit{Missed approach}, if
anything fails during compilation. In case this does not help we recommend sending a note to one of the mailing lists (for hints on subscription see Chapter \ref{landing}).

There are several \Index{Linux distributions} on the market, and most of them should work. Some come even bundled with (often outdated) versions of \FlightGear{}$\!$.
However, if you are going to download or buy a distribution, \Index{Debian} (Woody) is
suggested by most people. \Index{SuSE} works well, too.

Contrary to Linux/Unix systems, Windows usually comes without any development tools. This
way, you first have to install a development environment. On Windows, in a sense, before
building the plane you will have to build the plant for building planes. This will be the
topic of the following section, which can be omitted by Linux users.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Getting  a \Index{development environment} under Windows}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

There is a powerful development environment available for Windows and this even for free:
The Cygnus development tools,\index{Cygnus!development tools} resp. \Cygwin. Their home
is at
 \medskip

\web{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/},
 \medskip

 \noindent
and it is always a good idea to check back what is going on there now and then.

Nowadays, installing \Cygwin{}\index{Cygwin!setup} is nearly automatic. First, make sure
the drive you want \Cygwin{}, \PLIB{}, \SimGear{} and \FlightGear{} to live on, has
nearly 1 GB of free \Index{disk space}. Create a temporary directory and download the
installer from the site named above to that directory. (While the installer does an
automatic installation of the Cygnus environment, it is a good idea to download a new
installer from time to time.)

Invoke the installer now. It gives you three options. To avoid having to download stuff
twice in case of a re-installation or installation on a second machine, we highly
recommended to take a two-step procedure. First, select the option \texttt{Download from
Internet}. Insert the path of your temporary directory, your Internet connection settings
and then choose a mirror form the list. Near servers might be preferred, but may be
sometimes a bit behind with mirroring. We found
\medskip

\web{ftp://mirrors.rcn.net}
\medskip

 \noindent
a very recent and fast choice. In the next windows the default settings are usually a
good start. Now choose \texttt{Next}, sit back and wait.

If you are done, invoke the installer another time, now with the option
\texttt{Install from local directory}. After confirming the temporary directory you can
select a root directory (acting as the root directory of your pseudo UNIX file system).
Cygnus does not recommend taking the actual root directory of a drive, thus choose
\texttt{c:/Cygwin} (while other drives than \texttt{c:} work as well). Now, all \Cygwin{} stuff and all \FlightGear{} stuff lives under this directory. In addition, select

 \texttt{Default text file type: Unix}

 You are free to install the compiler for all users or just for you.

As a final step you should include the \Index{binary directory} (for instance:
\texttt{c:/Cygwin/bin}) into your path by adding \verb/path=c:\Cygwin\bin/ in
your \texttt{autoexec.bat} under Windows 95/98/ME. Under WindowsNT/2000/XP, use the \texttt{Extended} tab under the \texttt{System properties} page in Windows \texttt{control panel}. There you'll find a button \texttt{Environment variables}, where you can add the named directory.

Now you are done. Fortunately, all this is required only once. At this point you have
a nearly UNIX-like (command line) development environment. Because of this, the following
steps are nearly identical under Windows and Linux/Unix.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Compiling \FlightGear{} under Linux/Windows \index{compiling!Linux}\index{compiling!Windows}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A preliminary remark: For UNIX, make sure you have all necessary OpenGL libraries first.
Fortunately on all recent Linux distributions (i.e. SuSE-7.1) these are
already put on the right place. Be sure to install the proper package.
Besides the basic X11 stuff you want to have - SuSE as an example - the following packages: mesa, mesa-devel, mesasoft, xf86\_glx, xf86glu, xf86glu-devel, mesaglut, mesaglut-devel and
plib.

Also you are expected to have a bunch of tools installed that are usually
required to compile the Linux kernel. So you may use the Linux kernel source
package top determine the required dependencies. The following packages
might prove to be useful when fiddling with the FlightGear sources:
automake, autoconf, libtool, bison, flex and some more, that are not
required to build a Linux kernel.

Please compare the release of the Plib library with the one that ships with
your Linux distribution. It might be the case that FlightGear requires a
newer one that is not yet provided by your vendor.

Under Windows, the required libraries should have been installed with the \Cygwin{} installation above.

The following steps are identical under Linux/Unix and under Windows with minor
modifications. Under Windows, just open the \Cygwin{} icon from the Start menu or from
the desktop to get a command line.

To begin with, the \FlightGear{} build process is based on four packages which you need to built and installed in this order:

\begin{itemize}
\item PLIB
\item SimGear
\item FlightGear Program
\item FlightGear base (data - no compilation required)
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item First, choose an \Index{install directory} for FlightGear. This will not be the one your binaries will live in but the one for your source code and compilation files. We suggest

\texttt{cd:/usr/local/}

\texttt{mkdir source}

\item Now, you have to install a support library \PLIB\index{PLIB} which is absolutely essential for the building process. \PLIB{} contains most of the basic graphics
    rendering, audio, and joystick routines. Download the latest stable version of \PLIB\index{PLIB} from
     \medskip

    \web{http://plib.sourceforge.net/}
     \medskip

 \noindent
  to \texttt{/usr/local/source}. Change to that directory and unpack \PLIB{} using

        \texttt{tar xvfz plib-X.X.X.tar.gz}.

 \texttt{cd} into \texttt{plib-X.X.X} and run

        \texttt{./configure}\\
        \texttt{make}\\
        \texttt{make install}.

Under Linux, you have to become root for being able to \texttt{make install}, for
instance via the \texttt{su} command.

Confirm you now have \PLIB's header files\index{PLIB!header files} (as \texttt{ssg.h} etc.) under \texttt{/usr/include/plib} (and nowhere else).

\item Next, you have to install another library \SimGear{}\index{SimGear} containing the basic simulation routines.
 Get the most recent file \texttt{SimGear-X.X.X.tar.gz}\index{SimGear} from
  \medskip

 \web{ftp://ftp.simgear.org/pub/simgear/Source/}
  \medskip

 \noindent
Download it to \texttt{/usr/local/source}. Change to that directory and unpack \SimGear{}
using

        \texttt{tar xvfz SimGear-X.X.X.tar.gz}.

\noindent
 \texttt{cd} into \texttt{SimGear-X.X.X} and run

        \texttt{./configure}\\
        \texttt{make}\\
        \texttt{make install}

 \noindent
 Again, under Linux, you have to become root for being able to \texttt{make
install}, for instance via the \texttt{su} command.

\item Now, you're prepared to build \FlightGear{} itself, finally.
 Get \texttt{FlightGear-X.X.X.tar.gz} from
  \medskip

 \web{ftp://www.flightgear.org/pub/flightgear/Source/}
  \medskip

 \noindent
and download it to \texttt{/usr/local/source}. Unpack \FlightGear{} using
 \medskip

        \texttt{tar xvfz FlightGear-X.X.X.tar.gz}.
 \medskip

\texttt{cd} into \texttt{FlightGear-X.X.X} and run

        \texttt{./configure}
 \medskip

\Index{configure} knows about numerous options, \index{options, configure} with the more
relevant ones to be specified via switches as

\begin{itemize}
\item{\texttt{-$ $-with-network-olk}}:      Include Oliver Delise's multi-pilot \Index{networking  support},

\item{\texttt{-$ $-disable-network-olk}}:   Disable Oliver Delise's multi-pilot \Index{networking  support},

\item{\texttt{-$ $-with-old-weather}}:     Include original/simple \Index{weather subsystem},

\item{\texttt{-$ $-with-x}}:       Use the X Window  system (Linux only)\\

\item{\texttt{-$ $-prefix=/XXX}}: Install \FlightGear{} in the directory \texttt{XXX}.
\end{itemize}

A good choice would be \texttt{-$ $-prefix=/usr/local/FlightGear}. In this case
\FlightGear{}'s binaries\index{binaries!directory} will live under
\texttt{/usr/local/FlightGear/bin}. (If you don't specify a \texttt{-$ $-prefix} the binaries will go into \texttt{/usr/local/bin} while the base package files are expected under \texttt{/usr/local/lib/FlightGear}.)

Assuming \texttt{configure} finished successfully, run
 \medskip

        \texttt{make}\\
        \texttt{make install}.

 \noindent
 Again, under Linux, you have to become root for being able to \texttt{make
install}, for instance via the \texttt{su} command.

 \noindent
 Note:  You can save a significant amount of space by stripping all the
    debugging symbols off the executable.  To do this, make a
     \medskip

    \texttt{cd /usr/local/FlightGear/bin}

 \noindent
    to the directory in the \texttt{install tree} where your binaries live and run
     \medskip

    \texttt{strip *}.
  \end{enumerate}


 This completes building the executable and should result in a file \texttt{fgfs} (Unix) or
 \texttt{fgfs.exe} (Windows) under \texttt{/usr/local/FlightGear/bin}

\textbf{Note:} If for whatever reason you want to re-build the simulator, use the command
\texttt{make distclean} either in the \texttt{SimGear-X.X.X} or in the
\texttt{FlightGear-X.X.X} directory to remove all the build. If you want to re-run
\texttt{configure} (for instance because of having installed another version of \PLIB{}
etc.), remove the files \texttt{config.cache} from these same directories before.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Compiling \FlightGear{} under Mac OS 10.1 \index{compiling!MacIntosh}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

For compiling under Mac OS 10.1 you will need

\begin{itemize}
\item Mac OS 10.1 with 10.1 developer tools installed.
\item 500MB disk (conservative estimate, might be a little less).
\item Fearlessness of command line compiling.
\end{itemize}

This will need a bit more bravery than building under Windows or Linux. First, there are less people who tested it under sometimes strange configurations. Second, the process as described here itself nees a touch more experience by using CVS repositories.


First, download the development files. They are intended to simplify
the build process as much as possible:
\medskip

     \web{http://expert.cc.purdue.edu/~walisser/fg/fgdev.tar.gz}
\medskip

Once you have this extracted, make sure you are using tcsh, since the 
setup script requires it.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup the build environment:\\
 \texttt{cd fgdev}\\
 \texttt{source bin/prepare.csh}

\item Install automake/aclocal build tools\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src/automake-1.4-p4}\\
 \texttt{./configure -$ $-prefix={\$}BUILDDIR}\\
 \texttt{make install}
  \texttt{rehash}

\item Build PLIB\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src/plib-1.4.2}\\
 \texttt{aclocal}\\
 \texttt{automake}\\
 \texttt{./configure -$ $-prefix={\$}BUILDDIR -$ $-with-GL={\$}BUILDDIR}\\
 \texttt{make install}

\item Get the SimGear sources\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src}\\
 \texttt{setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvs@cvs.simgear.org:}\\
 \texttt{/var/cvs/SimGear-0.0} (one line)\\
 \texttt{cvs login}\\
 \# Enter "guest" for password\\
 \texttt{cvs -z3 checkout SimGear}\\

\item Build Metakit\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src/SimGear}\\
 \texttt{tar -zxvf metakit-X.X.X.tar.gz}\\
 \texttt{cd metakit-X.X.X/builds}\\
 \texttt{../unix/configure --prefix=\&BUILDDIR}\\
 \texttt{make}\\
 \texttt{make install}\\
 
\item Build SimGear\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src/SimGear}\\
 \texttt{./autogen.sh}\\
  \texttt{./configure --prefix={\$}BUILDDIR --host=powerpc}\\
 \texttt{make install}\\
 
\item Get the FlightGear sources
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src}\\
 \texttt{setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvs@cvs.flightgear.org:}\\
 \texttt{/var/cvs/FlightGear-0.7} (one line!)\\
 \texttt{cvs login}\\
 \#enter "guest" for password\\
 \texttt{cvs -z3 checkout FlightGear}

\item  Build FlightGear\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR/src/FlightGear}\\
 \texttt{patch -p0 < ../jsb.diff}\\ 
 \texttt{./autogen.sh}\\
 \texttt{./configure --prefix={\$}BUILDDIR -$ $-includedir=}\\
 \texttt{{\$}BUILDDIR --with-threads --without-x} (one line)
 
\item Get the base data files (if you don't have them already)\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR}\\
 \texttt{setenv CVSROOT :pserver:cvsguest@rockfish.net:}\\
 \texttt{/home/cvsroot} (one line)\\
 \texttt{cvs login}\\
 {\#}password is "cvsguest"\\
 \texttt{cvs -z3 checkout fgfsbase}

\item Move data files (if you have them already)\\
 just make a symlink or copy data files to "fgfsbase" in {\$}BUILDDIR

\item Run FlightGear\\
 \texttt{cd {\$}BUILDDIR}\\
 \texttt{src/FlightGear/src/Main/fgfs}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Compiling on other systems\index{compiling!other systems}\index{compiling!IRIX}\index{compiling!Solaris}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Compiling on other \Index{Unix} systems - at least on \Index{IRIX} and on
\Index{Solaris}, is pretty similar to the procedure on Linux - given the presence of a working GNU C compiler. Especially IRIX and also recent releases of Solaris come with the
basic OpenGL libraries.\index{OpenGL!libraries} Unfortunately the ''glut'' libraries are
mostly missing and have to be installed separately (see the introductory remark to this chapter). As compilation
of the ''glut'' sources is not a trivial task to everyone, you might want to use a
pre-built binary. Everything you need is a static library ''libglut.a'' and an include
file ''glut.h''. An easy way to make them usable is to place them into \texttt{/usr/lib/}
and \texttt{/usr/include/GL/}. In case you insist on building the library yourself, you
might want to have a look at \Index{FreeGLUT}
\medskip

\web{http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/}
 \medskip

 \noindent
which should compile with minor tweaks. Necessary patches might be found in
\medskip

\href{ftp://ftp.uni-duisburg.de/X11/OpenGL/freeglut_portable.patch}{ftp://ftp.uni-duisburg.de/X11/OpenGL/freeglut\_portable.patch}
 \medskip

 \noindent
Please note that you do \textbf{not} want to create 64 bit binaries in IRIX with
GCC (even if your CPU is a R10/12/14k) because GCC produces a broken ''fgfs'' binary (in
case the compiler does'nt stop with ''internal compiler error''). Things might look
better if Eric Hofman\index{Hofman, Eric} manages to tweak the FlightGear sources for
proper compiling with MIPSPro compiler (it's already mostly done).

There should be a workplace for Microsoft \Index{Visual C++} (MSVC6) included in the official
\FlightGear{} distribution. \Index{Macintosh} users find the required \Index{CodeWarrior}
files as a \texttt{.bin} archive at
 \medskip

\href{http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/~walisser/fg/}{http://icdweb.cc.purdue.edu/$\tilde{~~}$walisser/fg/}.

Numerous (although outdated, at times) hints on compiling on different systems are included in the source code under \texttt{docs-mini}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Installing the base package\index{base package!installation}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you succeeded in performing the steps named above, you will have a directory holding the
executables for \FlightGear{}$\!$. This is not yet sufficient for performing
\FlightGear{}$\!$, though. Besides those, you will need a collection of support data
files (scenery, aircraft, sound) collected in the so-called base package. In case you
compiled the latest official release, the accompanying base package is available from
 \medskip

\web{ftp://www.flightgear.org/pub/flightgear/Shared/fgfs-base-X.X.X.tar.gz}.

This package\index{base package!installation} is usually quite large (around 25 MB), but
must be installed for \FlightGear{} to run. There is no compilation required for it. Just download it to \texttt{/usr/local} and install it with
 \medskip

    \texttt{tar xvfz fgfs-base-X.X.X.tar.gz}.

 \noindent
Now you should find all the \FlightGear{} files under \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear} in the
following directory structure:\index{directory structure}\index{FlightGear!directory
structure}:
\medskip

 \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear}

 \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear/Aircraft}

 \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear/Aircraft-uiuc}

 \ldots

 \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear/bin}

 \ldots

 \texttt{/usr/local/Flightgear/Weather}.

\section{For test pilots only: Building the CVS snapshots}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It you are into adventures or feel you're an advanced user, you can try one of the recent \Index{bleeding edge snapshots}\index{snapshots} at
  \medskip

\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/}.
 \medskip

 \noindent
In this case you have to get the most recent Snapshot from \SimGear{} at
 \medskip

\web{http://www.simgear.org/downloads.html}
 \medskip

 \noindent
 as well. But be prepared: These are for development and may (and often do)
contain bugs.

If you are using these CVS snapshots, the base package named above will usually not be
in sync with the recent code and you have to download the most recent developer's version
from
 \medskip

 \web{http://rockfish.net/fg/}.
 \medskip

\noindent
We suggest downloading this package \texttt{fgfs$\_$base-snap.X.X.X.tar.gz} to a temporary
directory. Now, decompress it using
\medskip

 \texttt{tar xvfz fgfs$\_$base-snap.X.X.X.tar.gz}.
 \medskip
 
Finally, double-check you got the directory structure named above.
