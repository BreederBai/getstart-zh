\markboth{\thechapter.\hspace*{1mm} FLIGHT}{\thesection\hspace*{1mm} KEYBOARD
CONTROLS}

The following is a description of the main systems for controlling the
program and piloting the plane. It is assumed that the reader is already
familiar with flying, possibly from experience on other simulators. If you are
completely new to flying, the tutorials in section \ref{tutorials} are a better
resource for learning to fly using FlightGear{}.

A short leaflet showing the standard keys and designed to be printed can be found at
\medskip
\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Docs/FGShortRef.pdf}.
\medskip

\noindent
A reference to most of the keyboard controls can be found under the Help menu in the simulator.

\section{Starting the engine}\index{engine!starting}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Depending on the type of aircraft, you may have to start the engine(s) before you can
go flying. The instructions below are generic. Check the aircraft help or aircraft tutorials
for more specific instructions.

Once you've started the engine, you should check whether the \Index{parking brake}s are engaged.
If so, press the `B' to release them.

\subsection{Piston Aircraft}\index{engine!starting!piston}

For piston-engined aircraft, the magnetos are controlled by the `\{' and `\}' keys. On most aircraft, the starter is engaged using the `s' key. On multi-engined aircraft you can select which engines to control. Use `\~' to select all the engines at once. Most magnetos have 4 positions -
OFF, LEFT, RIGHT and BOTH. So, to start the selected engine, press the `\}' key three times, then hold down `s'.

Note that the starting procedure for powerful WWII-era fighter aircraft is often more complex. See the aircraft help for details.

\subsection{Turboprop Aircraft}\index{engine!starting!turboprop}

Starting a turbo-prop engine generally requires simply moving the condition lever from Off to Idle, using 'm'.

\subsection{Jet Aircraft}\index{engine!starting!jet}

Starting a jet aircraft is significantly more complex, and the controls vary between different aircraft.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Set cutoff ON
\item Engage the starter
\item Once the engines spools up to approximately 5\% N1, set cutoff OFF
\item Disengage the starter once the engine has reached operational speed.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Keyboard controls}\index{keyboard controls}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

While \Index{joystick}s, \Index{yoke}s and \Index{rudder pedals} are supported,
you can fly \FlightGear{} using the keyboard alone or in conjunction with a mouse,
described below. However you control the aircraft, you will need to use the keyboard
for at least some controls.

These key bindings\index{keybindings!configuration} are not hard-coded, but
user-adjustable. You can check and change these setting via the file
\texttt{keyboard.xml}\index{keyboard.xml} which can be found in the main
\FlightGear{} directory. This is a human-readable plain ASCII file.
Although it's perhaps not the best idea for beginners to modify this file,
more advanced users will find it useful to change key bindings according to
their wishes, e.g. to match other simulators.

\subsection{Aircraft controls}\index{keyboard controls!primary}

In order to have full control of the plane during flight using the keyboard you should ensure that
\texttt{\Index{NumLock}} is on, and the \FlightGear{} window is in focus. The following keys control
the primary aircraft control surfaces.

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab2}}
Table 1: \textit{Primary aircraft controls}
\medskip

The following keys control the engines\index{engine controls}.

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab7}}
Table 2: \textit{Engine control keys\index{keyboard controls! engine}}
\medskip

The following keys control secondary aircraft systems.

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab8}}
Table 3: \textit{Secondary aircraft controls\index{keyboard controls! aircraft}}
\medskip

Autopilot controls are as follows.

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab5}}
Table 4: \textit{Autopilot controls\index{keyboard controls! autopilot}}
\medskip

\subsection{Simulator controls}\index{keyboard controls!simulator controls}

To change the \Index{view direction}, you must de-activate \texttt{NumLock}. The available controls are as follows:
\medskip

\centerline{\input{tab3}}
Table 5: \textit{View directions\index{keyboard controls! view}}
\medskip

Additionally, the following keys allow you to control the display:
\medskip

\noindent
\centerline{\input{tab4}}
Table 6: \textit{Display options\index{display options}\index{keyboard controls! display}}
\medskip

Finally, the following general simulator controls are available.

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab8}}
Table 7: \textit{General simulator controls.\index{keyboard
controls! general}}
\medskip

\subsection{Autopilot controls}\index{keyboard controls!autopilot}

\FlightGear{} supports two types of \Index{autopilot} - a \Index{generic autopilot}
that works with all aircraft (even those that would not normally have an autopilot),
and aircraft-specific autopilots that are controlled from within the cockpit.

The generic autopilot is controlled via the following keys:

\medskip

\centerline{\input{tab5}}
\noindent
 Tab.\,6: \textit{Autopilot controls.\index{autopilot controls}}
\medskip

\noindent Ctrl + T is especially interesting as it makes your aircraft behave
like a cruise missile, and follow the terrain. Ctrl + U might be handy in case
you feel you're just about to crash.

When the \Index{autopilot} is enabled, some of the numeric keypad keys function
differently and adjust the autopilot rather than the controls themselves:

\medskip
\centerline{\input{tab6}}
\noindent
 Tab.\,7: \textit{Additional Autopilot controls.}
\medskip

Note that some keyboards use``.'' instead of ``,''.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Mouse-controlled actions\index{mouse, actions}\index{mouse}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

As well as selecting menu items and clicking on controls in the cockpit, your
mouse can be used for a variety of other valuable functions in \FlightGear{}.

There are three \Index{mouse modes}: Normal (the default), Control and View. You can
change between them by using the right mouse button.

\subsection{Normal mode}\index{mouse, normal}

In normal mode, you can control the menus and the panel controls. This mode is indicated by
a normal arrow cursor.

To change a switch or toggle, simply click on it with the left or middle mouse button.

To change a knob on a radio or linear control such as the throttle, click on the left
hand side to decrease the value, and the right hand side to increase the value. Click
with the left mouse button to make a small adjustment, or the right button to make a
large one. Some controls, such as radios, also support using the mouse wheel.

Pressing Ctrl-C highlights the clickable hotspots and objects.

\subsection{Control mode}\index{mouse, control}

In control mode you can control the aircraft flight controls by moving the mouse.
This mode is indicated by a cross-hair mouse cursor.

In this mode, moving the mouse left or right controls the ailerons and rolls the
aircraft. Moving the mouse forwards and or backwards controls the elevator and
changes the pitch of the aircraft.

Holding the left mouse button down changes the behaviour so that moving the
mouse left/right controls the rudder. Holding the middle mouse button down and
moving the mouse forwards/backwards controls the throttle.

Finally, the scroll-wheel may be used to set the elevator trim.

This mode is particularly useful if you do not have a joystick, as it provides much better
control of the aircraft than using the keyboard. If you intend to use the mouse to control
the aircraft regularly, it is recommended that you enabled auto-coordination, so the
ailerons are linked to the rudder. This can be done using \texttt{-$ $-enable-auto-coordination}
or selecting auto-coordination from the launcher.

\subsection{View mode}\index{mouse, view}

In view mode you can look around using the mouse. This mode is indicated by a double-headed
arrow cursor.

Simply moving the mouse pans and tilts your view in the current position. This is
particularly useful for looking around the cockpit, or out a side window. The
scroll-wheel can be used to zoom in or out. Clicking the left mouse button
resets the view back to its initial position, usually straight ahead.

Holding down the middle mouse button and moving the mouse allows you to move the viewpoint
itself left/right and up/down. Moving the mouse while both the middle button and Ctrl are
held down allows you to move the viewpoint forwards and backwards.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Menu entries}\index{menu entries}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The menu bar provides access to a variety of options for the simulator and the aircraft.
Many aircraft have their own menu items, for changing their registration to automatically
starting their engines. These can be found at the end of the menu bar.

To display or hide the menu bar, press F10. You can also display the menu automatically
by moving your mouse to the top of the screen.

The menu bar provides the following menus and options.

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{File}
 \begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Reset (Shift-Esc)} resets\index{reset flight} the flight to the selected starting
position. Comes in handy if you get lost or something goes wrong.
  \item \textbf{Screenshot (F3)} saves a screen shot\index{screenshot} as \\
\texttt{fgfs-screen-XXX.jpg} to the directory you started the program from, or whatever
directory you have set\texttt{/sim/paths/screenshot-dir} to.
  \item \textbf{Sound Configuration} configures the volume for various sound
channels, and whether they are heard outside the aircraft.
  \item \textbf{Quit (Esc)} exits\index{exit} the program.
 \end{itemize}

 \item \textbf{View}\index{view}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Display Options} configures various display options, including whether
  the 2D panel, frame rate and chat messages are displayed.
  \item \textbf{Rendering Options} configures various graphical features.
  This allows you to trade eye-candy such as shadows, 3D clouds and specular
reflections for frame-rate.
  To help you achieve a good balance, enable the ``Show Frame Rate'' option in the
Display Options menu, which will show the current frame-rate in frames-per-second
in the bottom right of the screen.
  Most people find a frame-rate of around 20fps adequate for flying. The
frame-rate is affected by the
  graphical features you have enabled, the current visibility (set by Z/z), the
number of objects in view
  and their level of detail (LOD).
  \item \textbf{View Options} configures which views are enabled.
  \item \textbf{Cockpit View Options} configures
the view within the cockpit, the pilot's head movement, black-out due
to high G, and redout due to negative G.
  \item \textbf{Adjust LOD Ranges} sets the range at which different
  levels of detail are displayed. This affects the textures and objects
displayed in the simulator.
  \item \textbf{Adjust View Position} displays the current view offset.
  You can adjust this by dragging the dials. Alternatively you can make small
adjustments   to your view-point using the mouse (see below).
  \item \textbf{Adjust HUD Properties} configures the Head Up Display (HUD)
settings, such as transparency and whether anti-aliasing is used to display it.
 \item \textbf{Toggle Glide Slope Tunnel} displays a virtual tunnel to guide
 you down to the runway on a normal approach path. Useful if you are having
 difficulties setting up your approach for landing.
  \item \textbf{Instant Replay (Ctrl-R)} controls the instant replay
feature - a good tool for checking your landings!
   \item \textbf{Stereoscopic View Options} configures stereoscopic display,
   using Red/Green glasses or other display methods.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Location}\index{location}
 \begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{Position Aircraft On Ground} positions the aircraft
   on the runway of any installed airport. You need to know the ICAO code for
the airport you wish to start from (e.g. KSFO for San Fransisco International).
   \item \textbf{Position Aircraft In Air} positions the aircraft at
   an arbitary point in the air. You must select a known ground point, e.g. an
airport, VOR, long/lat
   coordinates, and a position relative to that point, e.g distance, direction,
altitude. You can also
   set your initial speed and heading. This is useful for practising approaches.
   \item \textbf{Select Airport from List} positions the aircraft at an airport.
You can search amongst all the airports that you have installed.
Clicking Apply will place you at that airport on a runway appropriate for the current wind.
   \item \textbf{Random Attitude} Sets the aircraft with a random heading, speed
and attitude. Useful for practising recovery from unusual attitudes.
   \item \textbf{Tower position} configures the airport tower used for the Tower
   View and Tower View Look From views.
 \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Autopilot}\index{autopilot} This menu is only available for
aircraft that have the default
autopilot configured. Some aircraft may have their own autopilot which is
configured through the panel, in which case this menu is disabled.
 \begin{itemize}

   \item \textbf{Autopilot Settings} configures the aircraft autopilot.
   You can set the autopilot up in a variety of different ways - from simply
keeping the wings level, to following an ILS.
  \item \textbf{Route Manager} sets the route (waypoint) list for the autopilot.
Waypoints can be airports or fixes. The heading, distance and time to the
current waypoint may be displayed in the HUD.
  \item \textbf{Pop Waypoint} removes the top waypoint from the route list.
 \item \textbf{Clear Route} clears current route.
  \item \textbf{Set Lat/Lon Format} toggles the HUD Latitude/Longitude format
between decimal minutes and seconds.
 \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Environment}\index{weather}
 \begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Global Weather} shows the current weather.
  You can change the weather scenario between various general weather scenarios,
  configure weather manually,
  or use the weather reported by the closest weather reporting station (usually
  and airport) via METAR.
  \item \textbf{Local Weather} configures specific weather scenarios in
  the local area, which may change over time.
  \item \textbf{Local Weather Settings } allows you enable Local Weather, and fine tune local weather
  settings for performance.

Fig.\,6: \textit{The 3D cockpit of the Cessna 172.}
\medskip

Aircraft within \FlightGear{} can have both a 2-dimensional instrument panel
and a 3-dimensional cockpit. The 3-dimensional cockpit provides a much
more realistic pilot-eye view, but can be difficult to read with small
monitors.

The default Cessna 172P (c172p) has both a 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional
cockpit. The 3-dimensional cockpit is activated by default when you start
\FlightGear{}, but you can overlay the 2-dimensional instrument panel by
selecting \texttt{View->Toggle 2D Panel} from the menu, or pressing the ``P'' key.

All panel levers and knobs can be operated with the mouse. To change a
control, just click with the left/middle mouse button on the
corresponding knob/lever. For controls that have a range of positions,
using the middle mouse button for larger adjustments. In general, clicking
on the right side of a control will increase the value, while clicking the left side
of the control will decrease the value.

Some instruments (particularly radios) also support use of a mouse scroll-wheel
to change values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The Head Up Display\index{head up display}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\FlightGear{} also provides a \Index{HUD} (\textbf{H}ead \textbf{U}p
\textbf{D}isplay) \index{head up display}. HUDs are generally found in military
aircraft and some very advanced jets. However, \FlightGear{} also allows you
to use a HUD on many GA aircraft. To activat the HUD, press `h'.

The \Index{HUD} shown in Fig.\,7  displays all main flight parameters of the
plane. In the center you find the \Index{pitch indicator} (in degrees) with the
\Index{aileron indicator} above and the \Index{rudder indicator} below. A
corresponding scale for the elevator\index{elevation indicator} can be found
to the left of the pitch scale along with a pitch trim indicator. On the bottom
there is a simple \Index{turn indicator}.

There are two scales at the extreme left: The inner one displays the \Index{speed}
 (in kts) while the outer one indicates position of the \Index{throttle}.
The two scales on the extreme right display your \Index{height} - the left one
shows the height above ground while the right of it displays hieght above sea-level,
both being displayed in feet.

Besides this, the \Index{HUD} delivers some additions information. On the upper
left you will find date and time, along with your current position, in \Index{latitude}
and \Index{longitude}.

You can change color of the \textbf{HUD} using the ``H'' or ``'h''  key.
Pressing the toggle ``i/I'' minimizes/maximizes the HUD.
