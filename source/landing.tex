\section{A not so Short \Index{History} of \FlightGear{}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \FlightGear{} project goes back to a discussion among a group of net citizens in 1996 resulting in
a proposal written by David Murr\index{Murr, David} who, unfortunately, dropped out of
the project (as well as the net) later. The original \Index{proposal} is still available
from the \FlightGear{} web site and can be found under
 \medskip

\web{http://www.flightgear.org/proposal-3.0.1}.
 \medskip

\noindent
 Although the names of the people and several of the details have changed over time,
the spirit of that proposal has clearly been retained up to the present time.

Actual coding started in the summer of 1996 and by the end of that year essential
graphics routines were completed. At that time, programming was mainly performed and
coordinated by Eric Korpela\index{Korpela, Eric} from Berkeley University. Early code ran
under \Index{Linux} as well as under \Index{DOS}, \Index{OS/2}, \Index{Windows 95/NT},
and \Index{Sun-OS}. This was found to be quite an ambitious project as it involved, among
other things, writing all the \Index{graphics routines} in a system-independent way
entirely from scratch.

Development slowed and finally stopped in the beginning of 1997 when Eric was completing
his thesis. At this point, the project seemed to be dead and traffic on the mailing list
went down to nearly nothing.

It was Curt Olson\index{Olson, Curt} from the University of Minnesota who re-launched the
project in the middle of 1997. His idea was as simple as it was powerful: Why invent the
wheel a second time? There have been several free flight simulators\index{Flight
simulator!free} available running on \Index{workstation}s under different flavors of
\Index{UNIX}. One of these, \Index{LaRCsim} (developed by Bruce Jackson\index{Jackson,
Bruce} from NASA), seemed to be well suited to the approach. Curt took this one apart and
re-wrote several of the routines such as to make them build as well as run on the
intended target platforms. The key idea in doing so was to exploit a system-independent
graphics platform: \Index{OpenGL}.

Fig.\,8: \textit{\Index{LaRCsim}'s \Index{Navion} is still available in \FlightGear.}
\medskip

In addition, a clever decision on the selection of the basic \Index{scenery} data was
made in the very first version. \FlightGear{} scenery is created based on satellite data
published by the \Index{U.\,S. Geological Survey}. These terrain data are available from
 \medskip

 \web{http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/doc/edchome/ndcdb/ndcdb.html}
 \medskip

\noindent
 for the U.S., and
  \medskip

 \web{http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/landdaac/gtopo30/gtopo30.html},
  \medskip

\noindent
 resp., for other countries. Those freely accessible scenery data, in
 conjunction with scenery building tools included with
 \FlightGear{}$\!$, are an important feature enabling anyone to
  create his or her own scenery.

This new \FlightGear{} code - still largely being based on the original \Index{LaRCsim}
code - was released in July 1997. From that moment the project gained momentum again.
Here are some milestones in the more recent development history:

\begin{itemize}

\item The display of sun, moon and stars have been a weak point for PC flight simulators
 for a long time. It is one of the great achievements of \FlightGear{} to include accurate modeling
 and display of sun, moon, and planets very early. The corresponding \Index{astronomy code}
 was implemented in fall 1997 by Durk Talsma\index{Talsma, Durk}.

\item Texture support\index{textures} was added by Curt
Olson\index{Olson, Curt} in spring 1998. This marked a
 significant improvement in terms of reality. You may recall that Microsoft Flight Simulator had
 non-textured scenery up until version 4.0. Some high-quality
 textures were submitted by Eric Mitchell\index{Mitchell, Eric}
  for the \FlightGear{} project.

\item A \Index{HUD} (\Index{head up display}) was added based on code
 provided by Michele America\index{America, Michele} and
 Charlie Hotch\-kiss\index{Hotchkiss, Charlie} in the fall of 1997 and was improved
 later by Norman Vine. While not generally available for real \Index{Cessna 172}, the HUD
 conveniently reports the actual flight performance of the simulation and may be of further use
 in military jets later.

\item After improving the \Index{scenery} and
\Index{texture} support  frame rate\index{frame rate} dropped down to a point where
\FlightGear{} became
 unflyable in spring 1998. This issue was resolved by exploiting hardware \Index{OpenGL}
  support, which became available at that time, and implementing
  \Index{view frustrum culling} (a rendering technique that ignores the
 part of the scenery not visible in a scene), done by Curt Olson\index{Olson, Curt}.
 Taking these measures made \FlightGear{} flyable again as long as they included a 3-D graphics board that featured
 hardware \Index{OpenGL} support. With respect to \Index{frame rate} one should keep
 in mind that the code, at present, is in no way optimized, which leaves room for further
 improvements.

\item A rudimentary \Index{autopilot} implementing heading hold was
contributed by Jeff Goeke-Smith\index{Goeke-Smith, Jeff} in April 1998. It was improved
by the addition of an altitude hold and a terrain following switch in October 1998 and
further developed by Norman Vine\index{Vine, Norman} later.

\item The basis for a menu system\index{menu} was laid based on another library,
 the Portable Library \PLIB\index{PLIB}, in June 1998. After having been idle for a time, the first
 working menu entries came to life in spring 1999.

  \PLIB{} underwent rapid development later. It has been distributed as a separate package by
  Steve Baker with a much broader range of applications in mind, since spring 1999. It
  has provided the basic graphics rendering engine for \FlightGear{} since fall 1999.

\item Friedemann Reinhard \index{Reinhard, Friedemann}
 developed early \Index{instrument panel} code, which was added in June 1998. Unfortunately,
 development of that panel slowed down later, partly because of \Index{OpenGL} compatibility
 problems. Finally, David Megginson \index{Megginson, David} decided to rebuild the panel code from scratch in January 2000. This led to a rapid
  addition of new instruments and features to the panel, resulting in nearly all main
  instruments being included until spring 2001. A handy minipanel was added in summer 2001.

\item In 1998 there was basic \Index{audio support}, i.\,e. an audio library
and some basic background engine sound. This was later integrated into the
above-mentioned portable library, \PLIB\index{PLIB}. This same library was extended to
support joystick/yoke/rudder\index{joystick} in October 1999, again marking a huge step
in terms of realism. To adapt on different joystick, configuration options were
introduced in fall 2000.

\item In September 1998 Curt Olson\index{Olson, Curt}
 succeeded in creating a complete terrain model for the U.S. The
  scenery is available worldwide via a clickable map \index{map, clickable} at:
   \medskip

\web{http://www.flightgear.org/Downloads/world-scenery.html}.
 \medskip

\item Networking/multiplayer\index{networking code}\index{multiplayer code}
 code has been integrated by Oliver Delise \index{Delise, Oliver} and Curt
Olson\index{Olson, Curt} starting fall 1999. This effort is aimed at enabling
\FlightGear{}  to run concurrently on several machines over a network, either an Intranet
or the \Index{Internet}, coupling it to a \Index{flight planner} running on a second
machine, and more. There emerged several approaches for remotely controlling FlightGear over a Network during 2001. Notably there was added support working together wirth the ''Atlas'' moving map program. Besides, an embedded HTTP server developed late in 2001 by Curt Olson\index{Olson, Curt} can now act a property manager for external programs.

\item Christian Mayer, \index{Mayer, Christian}  together with Durk Talsma,\index{Talsma, Durk}
contributed weather code in the winter of 1999. This included \Index{clouds},
\Index{winds}, and even \Index{thunderstorms}.

\item Manually changing \Index{views} in a flight simulator is in a sense always ''unreal'' but
nonetheless required in certain situations. A possible solution was supplied by Norman
Vine\index{Vine, Norman} in the winter of 1999 by implementing code for changing views
using the mouse. Alternatively, you can use a hat switch for this purpose, today.

\item Finally, \Index{LaRCsim}s \Index{Navion} was replaced as the default aircraft
 when the \Index{Cessna 172} was stable enough in February 2000 - a move most users will welcome. There are now several \Index{flight model} options to choose from at runtime: a modified and improved LaRCsim \Index{Cessna 172} developed by Tony Peden\index{Peden, Tony}, Jon Berndt's
\index{Berndt, Jon, S.} \Index{X15}, and Christian Mayer's \index{Mayer, Christian} hot
air balloon. Jon Berndt\index{Berndt, Jon, S.} has invested a lot of time in a more
realistic and versatile flight model with a more powerful aircraft configuration method.
\JSBSim, as it has come to be called, may eventually replace LaRCsim as the default
flight dynamics model (FDM), and it is planned to include such features as fuel slosh
effects, turbulence, complete flight control systems, and other features not often found
all together in a flight simulator. As an alternative, Andy Ross\index{Ross, Andy} added another flight dynamics model called \YASim{} (Yet Another Flight Dynamics Simulator) which aims at simpliciy of use, by the end of 2001. This one bought us flight modles for a 747, an A4, and a DC-3.

\item The scenery was further improved by adding geographic features including lakes, rivers,
and coastlines later, an effort still going on. Since the end of 2000, there was again
stronger focus on scenery. Textured runways were added by Dave Cornish\index{Cornish,
Dave} in spring 2001. Light textures add to the visual impression at night. To cope with
the constant growth of scenery data, a binary scenery format was introduced in spring
2001. 

\item A fully operational radio stack and working radios were added to the panel by Curt
Olson\index{Olson, Curt} in spring 2000. A huge database of Navaids contributed by Robin
Peel allows IFR navigation since then.

\item A \Index{property manager} was implemented by David Megginson\index{Megginson, David} in
fall 2000. It allows parsing a file called \texttt{.fgfsrc}\index{.fgfsrc} under
UNIX/Linux and \texttt{system.fgfsrc}\index{system.fgfsrc} under Windows for input
options. This plain ASCII file has proven useful in submitting the growing number of
input options, and notably the \Index{joystick settings}. This has proven a useful
concept, and joystick, keyboard, and panel settings are no longer hard coded but set
using *.xml files since spring 2001 thanks to work mainly by David Megginson and John
Check.\index{Check, John}

\item There was support added for static objects to the scenery in 2001, which permits placing buildung, static planes, trees and so on in the scenery. However, despite a few profs systematic includion of these landmarks is still missing.

\item There was basic ATC support added in fall 2001 by David Luff\index{Luff, David}. This is not yet fully implemented, but displaying ATIS messages is already possible.

\item A magneto switch with proper functions was added at the end of 2001 by John Check\index{Check, John} and David Megginson.\index{Megginson, David}. Actually, several panels were vastly improved during 2001 by John and others.
\end{itemize}

During development there were several code reorganization efforts. Various code
subsystems were moved into packages. As a result, presetnly code is organized as follows:
\medskip

The base of the graphics engine is \textbf{\Index{OpenGL}}, a platform independent
graphics library. Based on \Index{OpenGL}, the Portable Library \PLIB{}\index{PLIB}
provides basic rendering, audio, joystick etc. routines. Based on \PLIB\index{PLIB} is
\SimGear{}\index{SimGear}, which includes all of the basic routines required for the
flight simulator as well as for building scenery. On top of \SimGear{}\index{SimGear}
there are (i) \FlightGear{}\index{FlightGear} (the simulator itself), and (ii)
\TerraGear{}\index{TerraGear}, which comprises the scenery building tools.

This is by no means an exhaustive history and most likely some people who have made
important contributions have been left out. Besides the above-named contributions there
was a lot of work done concerning the internal structure by: Jon S. Berndt\index{Berndt,
Jon, S.}, Oliver Delise, \index{Delise, Oliver} Christian Mayer, \index{Mayer, Christian}
Curt Olson,\index{Olson, Curt} Tony Peden, \index{Peden, Tony} Gary R. Van
Sickle\index{van Sickle, Gary, R.}, Norman Vine\index{Vine, Norman}, and others. A more
comprehensive list of contributors can be found in Chapter \ref{landing} as well as in
the \texttt{Thanks} file provided with the code. Also, the \FlightGear{}

\section{What remains to be done}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

If you read (and, maybe, followed) this guide up to this point you may probably agree: \FlightGear{}$\!$, even in its present state, is not at all for the birds. It is
already a flight simulator which sports even several selectable flight models, several planes with panels and even a HUD, terrain scenery, texturing, all the basic controls and weather.

Despite, \FlightGear{} needs -- and gets -- further development. Except internal tweaks,
there are several fields where \FlightGear{} needs basics improvement and development. A
first direction is adding \Index{airport}s, streets, and more of those things bringing
scenery to real life and belonging to realistic airports. Another task is further
implementation of the \Index{menu system}, which should not be too hard with the basics
being working now. A lot of options at present set via command line or even during
compile time should finally make it into menu entries. Finally, \FlightGear{} lacks any
\Index{ATC} until now. 

There are already people working in all of these directions. If you're a programmer and
think you can contribute, you are invited to do so.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection*{Achnowledgements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Obviously this document could not have been written without all those contributors
mentioned above making \FlightGear{} a reality.

First, I was very glad to see Martin Spott \index{Spott, Martin} entering the documentation effort. Martin provided not only several updates and contributions (notably in the OpenGL section) on the Linux side of the project but also several general ideas on the documentation in general

Besides, I would like to say special thanks to Curt Olson,\index{Olson, Curt} whose
numerous scattered Readmes, Thanks, Webpages, and personal eMails were of special help to
me and were freely exploited in the making of this booklet.

Next, Bernhard Buckel \index{Buckel, Bernhard} wrote several sections of early versions
of that Guide and contributed at lot of ideas to it.

Jon S. Berndt \index{Berndt, Jon, S.} supported me by critical proofreading of several
versions of the document, pointing out inconsistences and suggesting improvements.

Moreover, I gained a lot of help and support from Norman Vine\index{Vine, Norman}. Maybe,
without Norman's answers I would have never been able to tame different versions of the
\Cygwin{} -- \FlightGear{} couple.

We were glad, our Mac expert Darrell Walisser \index{Walisser, Darrell} contributed the section on compiling under Mac OS X. In addition he submitted several Mac related hints and fixes.

Further contributions and donations on special points came from John Check,\index{Check,
John} (general layout), Oliver Delise \index{Delise, Oliver} (several suggestions
including notes on that chapter), Mohit Garg \index{Garg, Mohit} (OpenGL), Kyler B. Laird
\index{Laird, Kyler B.} (corrections), Alex Perry\index{Perry, Alex} (OpenGL), and Kai
Troester\index{Troester, Kai} (compile problems).

Besides those whose names got lost withing the last-minute-trouble we'd like to express our
gratitude to the following people for contributing valuable 'bug fixes' to this version of Getting Started (in random order): Cameron Moore,\index{Moore, Cameron} Melchior Franz,\index{Franz, Melchior} David Megginson,\index{Megginson, David} Jon Berndt,\index{Berndt, Jon} Alex Perry,\index{Perry, Alex}, Dave Perry,\index{Perry, Dave}, Andy Ross,\index{Ross, Andy} Erik Hofman.\index{Hofman, Erik}
